There is an [article]({{ site.baseur }}/2019/11/16/go_on_not_so_small_hardware.html) that describes the first steps with Embedded Go. It assumes you use some kind of Unix like operating system (Linux, OS X, *BSD). This article will be updated until we create a more general description here.

We are waiting for any success story on Windows. Please send a link or do a pull reqeust with an article text to the [github.com/embeddedgo/embeddedgo.github.io](https://github.com/embeddedgo/embeddedgo.github.io/).
